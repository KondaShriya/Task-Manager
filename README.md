# Task-Manager

The Task Management API is designed to facilitate efficient management of tasks for individual users as well as administrators. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, with essential attributes such as title, description, due date, and status. The API incorporates user authentication to ensure security and privacy, with admin users having full access to all tasks.

User Authentication
User authentication is a crucial aspect of the API, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify their tasks. Admin users are granted elevated privileges to access all tasks within the system.

Update Task: Users can update task details, including modifying the title, description, due date, or status.

Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, indicating that the task has been finished.

Delete Task: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.

Database
The API employs a database system to persistently store task data. The choice of database can vary based on project requirements, but commonly used options include relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

Comprehensive documentation accompanies the API, covering various aspects such as:

Authentication Procedures: Detailed instructions on how users can authenticate themselves to access the API endpoints securely.
